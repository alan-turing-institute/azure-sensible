# Users to create
#
# Declare each user as a new list item. Each user requires the following keys,
#   - name: Full name
#   - username: Linux username (used to login)
#   - password: A password hash for the user (required for sudo). See
#               https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-generate-encrypted-passwords-for-the-user-module
#               or use scripts/generate_password.py to create a suitable hash.
#   - ssh_key: A list of the users public ssh key(s). List items can take a number of forms,
#                1. A string of a single public key (with no newlines)
#                2. A url of the public keys associated with a GitHub account
#                   "https://github.com/<username>.keys"
#                3. A jinja2 template to fetch key(s) from a file
#                   "{{ lookup('file', '/home/harry/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
#              Examples of all three are given below.
#   - groups: A list of groups to add the user to, add users to the "admin"
#             group to allow them to use sudo
